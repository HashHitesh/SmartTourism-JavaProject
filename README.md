# SmartTourismJava

The Smart Tourism system is designed in such a way that a tourist arriving at a unknown place eager to explore what the place is offering could do so with ease our system combines the complex management systems of restaurant booking , hotel management , sightseeing management and a guide to public transport under a single package so as the consumer is not forced to visit different websites for each individual task he could do everything and more under our Smart Tourism management.


This Smart Tourism encompasses different managements such as:

-Tourist Hotspot

-Tourist Hotel Management

-Restaurant Management

-Transport
