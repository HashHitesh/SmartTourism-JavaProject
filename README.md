# SmartTourismJava
Java Code for Smart Tourism project.


The Smart Tourism system is designed in such a way that a tourist arriving at a unknown place eager to explore what the place is offering could do so with ease our system combines the complex management systems of restaurant booking , hotel management , sightseeing management and a guide to public transport under a single package so as the consumer is not forced to visit different websites for each individual task he could do everything and more under our Smart Tourism management.
